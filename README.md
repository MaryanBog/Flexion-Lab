# 🧪 Flexion Lab — Applied Systems

**Flexion Lab** is the applied layer of the Flexion Framework.  
It contains all practical systems, SDKs, simulations, and technologies built on the foundational theories of Flexion Science.

Flexion Lab transforms structural principles (∆, Φ, M, κ) into real-world products, algorithms, and tools.

## 🔷 Mission
To provide a unified applied environment for Flexion Science by organizing:

- practical systems,
- operator architectures,
- models,
- simulations,
- SDKs,
- analysis and visualization tools.
