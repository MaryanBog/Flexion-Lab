FRE Risk Engine — Version 1.2 (Documentation Modernization)

This release introduces a full modernization of the Flexion Risk Engine documentation and project structure.

### 📘 Summary
Version 1.2 updates the public-facing documentation of the FRE project to align with the new scientific foundation — Flexion Dynamics V2.0. 
The underlying implementation remains unchanged (based on V1.x), but the conceptual architecture and repository structure are now prepared for the transition to FRE V2.0.

### 🔧 What’s New in v1.2
- Fully updated README.md with the modern Δ–Φ–M–κ structural model
- Integration of the Viability Domain (κ ≥ 0) concept at the documentation level
- Updated technical descriptions and positioning for industry use

These will be part of the upcoming FRE V2.0 development cycle.
