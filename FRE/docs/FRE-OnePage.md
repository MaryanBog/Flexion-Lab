# FRE — Flexion Risk Engine  
## Structural Deviation, Instability, and Collapse Analysis for Advanced AI & Engineering Systems

---

## 1. Problem
Modern AI systems, autonomous platforms, and complex engineering architectures can enter unstable regimes:  
accelerating deviation, runaway feedback loops, threshold-triggered failures, and irreversible collapse points.  
Existing tools cannot detect *structural* early-warning signals before instability becomes visible.

---

## 2. Our Solution
**FRE (Flexion Risk Engine)** is an operator-based system for predicting:  
- deviation accumulation,  
- instability growth,  
- threshold crossings,  
- structural points of no return,  
- collapse trajectories and possible recovery paths.

FRE analyzes *structural deviation dynamics*, not just surface metrics — enabling detection of risks invisible to traditional methods.

## 3. Key Capabilities
- Detection of hidden instabilities in AI models and autonomous systems.  
- Modeling of threshold events and irreversible divergence.  
- Analysis of runaway behaviors and uncontrolled feedback cycles.  
- Predictive collapse trajectory mapping.  
- System robustness evaluation before deployment.  
- Works across any complex system: AI pipelines, robotics, digital twins, industrial automation, critical infrastructure.
